### FTP
File transfer protocol runs on ports `20` (control) and `21` (data). A similar version named TFTP exists that runs on `UDP`. Here's the [docs](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp) 

Connecting to FTP:
```shell
ftp <IP>
```

Downloading and uploading files:
```shell
ftp> GET <file path>

ftp> PUT <file path>
```

The classic `ls` and `cd` commands work too.
### SMB
Refer to [[SMB-Reference.pdf]]
# Remote Connections
### SSH
```shell
ssh user@server
```
### Telnet
```
telnet ip port
```
### Netcat
See the [docs](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) for more info.
```
netcat ip port
```
# Mail
### SMTP
Need to telnet into port 25 for access.
