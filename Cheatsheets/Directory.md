This repository and vault serves as a collection of my notes for quick reference. It's based on my own private vault, but removes any details that may be used in course materials. If you're pulling from git, use obsidian.md to view this vault.

Each note will be referenced by category. This repository won't always have the latest news for anything or be 100% accurate, it simply serves as a way for others to access what I've learned in an organized manner.
